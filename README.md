Analyzing YouTube channel stats  
Exploratory Data Analysing Using Youtube Video Data from one of my favorite YT tech channels, "Trakin Tech"

In this project I've tried to do some Exploratory Data Analysis on Trakin Tech's YT channel:
i) I have analyzed their Top performing and Worst performing videos
ii) The views distribution per video, as in what's the general range of views these videos receive
iii) Does the number of Likes and Comments matter in the Views of the videos
iv) What days of the week they mostly post their videos
v) What are the most commonly used words in their videos
